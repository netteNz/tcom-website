                        <h2 class="h2"> OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection)</h2>
                        <p class="font-weight-bold">is a reference model for how applications communicate over a
                            network.
                        </p>
                        <br>


                        <p>A reference model is a conceptual framework for understanding relationships. The
                            purpose of the
                            OSI reference model is to guide vendors and developers so the digital communication products
                            and
                            software programs they create can interoperate, and to facilitate a clear framework that
                            describes the functions of a networking or telecommunication system.
                            Most vendors involved in telecommunications make an attempt to describe their products and
                            services in relation to the OSI model. And although it is useful for guiding discussion and
                            evaluation, OSI is rarely actually implemented as-is. That's because few network products or
                            standard tools keep related functions together in well-defined layers, as is the case in the
                            OSI
                            model. The TCP/IP protocol suite, which defines the internet, does not map cleanly to the
                            OSI
                            model.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="h2">DoD Four Layer Model</h2>
                        <p class="font-weight-bold">The Department of Defense created TCP/IP to ensure and preserve date
                            integrity. The DoD model is a condensed version of the OSI model and only has four layers.
                        </p>
                        <p>The four layers of the DoD Model are as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Application layer (Layer 4) The application layer is where higher-layer protocols,
                                services, and applications such as HTTP, DNS, SMTP, and FTP function and reside. The
                                application layer roughly overlays the application, presentation, and session layers of
                                the OSI model.</li>

                            <li>Host-to-host or transport layer (Layer 3) The host-to-host layer is where protocols such
                                as TCP and UDP reside. It handles flow control, connection and session establishment,
                                maintenance, and teardown. The host-to-host layer roughly overlays the transport layer
                                of the OSI model.</li>

                            <li>The Internet layer (Layer 2) The Internet layer is where protocols such as IP reside and
                                handles the logical addressing and routing of data across the network. The Internet
                                layer roughly overlays the network layer of the OSI model.</li>
                            <li>The network access layer (Layer 1) The network access layer handles the physical
                                addressing and delivery of data across the network and is where protocols such as 802.2,
                                802.3, and Ethernet reside. The network access layer roughly overlays the datalink and
                                physical layer of the OSI model.</li>

                        </ul>
